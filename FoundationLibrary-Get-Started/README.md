# How to Setup a new Foundation Library

This example describes how to setup a new Foundation Library in MicroEJ SDK.

A Foundation Library is a library that provides core runtime APIs or hardware-dependent functionality. It is often connected to underlying C low-level APIs.

## Prerequisites

1. MicroEJ SDK 4.1.4 installed.
2. A MicroEJ 4.1 Platform Reference Implementation imported into the MicroEJ repository. See https://developer.microej.com/getting-started-sdk.html.
3. An activated Evaluation or Production license.
4. Basic knowledge about Java and C programming.
5. Basic knowledge about MicroEJ (Platform build and Standalone Application launch).

## Overview

A Foundation Library is composed of
* A MicroEJ API project: contains API skeletons for compilation purpose.
* A MicroEJ Implementation project: contains the runtime code executed by the Platform and Low Level C header files.
* C code: contains the implementation of native methods linked to the C project.
* Java Mock-up project: contains the implementation of native methods for simulation.

## Create the Foundation Library API

### Define the API Project

* Select **File > New > Other > EasyAnt > EasyAnt Project**
	* Set the project settings.
		* Project Name: mylib-api
		* Organization: com.mycompany.api
		* Module: mylib
		* Revision: 1.0.0
	* Select **com.is2t.easyant.skeletons#microej-javaapi;+** skeleton.
	* Click on **Finish**.

* Select **File > New > Class**
	* Source folder: **mylib-api/src/main/java**.
	* Package: **com.mycompany**.
	* Name: **MyLib**.

* Copy and paste the following code into this class:

```
package com.mycompany;

/**
 * My Foundation Library.
 */
public class MyLib {
	/**
	 * Computes the factorial of an integer.
	 *
	 * @param number
	 *            a positive integer
	 *
	 * @return the factorial of number.
	 */
	public static int factorial(int number) {
		throw new RuntimeException();
	}
}

```

This class defines a _factorial_ API. The method content is filled with **throw a new RuntimeException** just for successful compilation.

### Build the API Project

Right-click on **mylib-api** project and select **Build With EasyAnt**. 
After a successful build, the project build directory **target~/artifacts** contains:

* **Jar** file (mylib.jar), that will be used by an Application.
* **Rip** file (mylib.rip), that will be embedded into a Platform.

### Add the API to the Platform

* Unzip **mylib.rip** and copy all the files of the **content** directory into the **dropins** directory of the __[platform]-configuration__ project.
* Rebuild the Platform.

The API documentation is available in the MicroEJ Resource Center View (**Help > MicroEJ Resource Center > Javadoc**).

## Create the Foundation Library Implementation

### Define the Implementation Project

* Select **File > New > Other > EasyAnt > EasyAnt Project**
	* Set the project settings. 
		* Project Name: mylib-impl
		* Organization: com.mycompany.impl
		* Module: mylib
		* Revision: 1.0.0
	* Select **com.is2t.easyant.skeletons#microej-javaimpl;+** skeleton.
	* Click on **Finish**.

* Select **File > New > Class** .
	* Source folder: **mylib-impl/src/main/java**.
	* Package: **com.mycompany**
	* Name : **MyLib**

* Copy and paste the following code into this class:

```
package com.mycompany;

@SuppressWarnings({ "javadoc", "nls" })
public class MyLib {

	public static int factorial(int number) {
		if (number < 0) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Factorial cannot be negative");
		}
		return factorial0(number);
	}

	public native static int factorial0(int number);
}
	
```

This class defines the _factorial_ implementation. It first checks the argument validity and then redirects to a native method for speed consideration.

### Write the C Header File

* Create a new file named **include/LLMYLIB_impl.h** into the **content** directory of the implementation project.
* Copy and paste the following code into this file:

```
#ifndef LLMYLIB_IMPL
#define LLMYLIB_IMPL

/**
 * @file
 * @brief MicroEJ factorial Low Level API
 * @author My Company
 * @version 1.0.0
 */

#include <stdint.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#define LLMYLIB_IMPL_factorial Java_com_mycompany_MyLib_factorial0

/*
 * Returns the factorial
 */
uint32_t LLMYLIB_IMPL_factorial(uint32_t number);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif

```

This file defines the _factorial_ C prototype. The **com_mycompany_MyLib** part is the fully qualified name of the **MyLib** class created previously where all **.** are replaced by **_**.

The _#define_ statement allows to separate the Java part and the C part. 
This is called the Low Level API of the Foundation Library.
If the fully qualified name of the Java native method is updated, the C implementation code do not need to be updated.



### Build the Implementation Project

Right-click on **mylib-impl** project and select **Build With EasyAnt**.
After a successful build, the project build directory **target~/artifacts** contains:

* **Rip** file (mylib.rip), that will be embedded into a Platform.

### Add the Implementation to the Platform 

* Unzip **mylib.rip** and copy all the files of the **content** directory into the **dropins** directory of the __[platform]-configuration__ project.
* Rebuild the Platform.

## Test the Foundation Library from an Example

### Define the Application Project

* Create a new project **File > New > MicroEJ Standalone Application Project**
	* Project Name: **mylib-test**
	* Check **MYLIB-1.0** in the section **Runtime Environment > Select MicroEJ libraries**

* Select **File > New > Class**
	* Source folder: **mylib-test/src**.
	* Package: **com.mycompany**
	* Class Name: **TestMyLib**
	
* Copy and paste the following code into this class:

```
package com.mycompany;

public class TestMyLib {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("(5!)=" + MyLib.factorial(5));
	}
}

```

This class defined a main entry point that prints the result of _5!_.

### Launch the Application on Simulator

* Right-click on **mylib-test** project and select **Run As > MicroEJ Application**. 

The application is started. After a few seconds, the following trace shall appear in the console view:

```
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No HIL client implementor found (timeout)
        at java.lang.Throwable.fillInStackTrace(Throwable.java:79)
        at java.lang.Throwable.<init>(Throwable.java:30)
        at java.lang.Error.<init>(Error.java:10)
        at java.lang.LinkageError.<init>(LinkageError.java:10)
        at java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError.<init>(UnsatisfiedLinkError.java:10)
        at com.mycompany.MyLib.factorial(MyLib.java:15)
        at com.mycompany.TestMyLib.main(TestMyLib.java:5)
        at java.lang.MainThread.run(Thread.java:836)
        at java.lang.Thread.runWrapper(Thread.java:372)

```

This is the normal behavior because **factorial0** native method is currently not implemented (see below). 
The HIL engine (Hardware In the Loop) did not find a Platform Mock-up implementing the native method.

## Create the Foundation Library Mock-up

### Define the Mock-up Project

To each MicroEJ native method is associated a Java Mock-up method that implements the simulated behavior. 
A Mock-up project is a standard Java project (J2SE).

* Select **File > New > Other > EasyAnt > EasyAnt Project**
	* Set the project settings. 
		* Project Name: mylib-mock
		* Organization: com.mycompany.mock
		* Module: mylib
		* Revision: 1.0.0
	* Select **com.is2t.easyant.skeletons#microej-mock;+** skeleton.
	* Click on **Finish**.

* Select **File > New > Class**
	* Source folder: **mylib-mock/src/main/java**.
	* Package: **com.mycompany**
	* Class Name: **MyLib**
* Copy and paste the following code into this class:

```
package com.mycompany;

public class MyLib {

	public static int factorial0(int number) {
		if (number == 0) {
			return 1;
		}
		int fact = 1; // this will be the result
		for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
			fact *= i;
		}
		return fact;
	}
}

```
This class defines the implementation _factorial0_ method on Simulator. 
The Mock-up method has the same prototype than the implementation one, except the **native** modifier. 
The HIL engine will link the native method to the Mock-up method.

### Build the Mock-up Project

* Right-click on the **mylib-mock** project and select **Build With EasyAnt**.

After a successful build, the project build directory **target~/artifacts** contains:

* **Rip** file (mylib.rip), that will be embedded into a Platform.

### Add the Mock-up to the Platform 

* Unzip **mylib.rip** and copy all the files of the **content** directory into the **dropins** directory of the __[platform]-configuration__ project.
* Rebuild the Platform.

### Launch the Application on Simulator

* Right-click on **mylib-test** project and select **Run As > MicroEJ Application**. 

The following trace shall appear in the console view:
 
```
		=============== [ Initialization Stage ] ===============
		=============== [ Launching on Simulator ] ===============
		(5!)=120
		=============== [ Completed Successfully ] ===============

```

## Implement Low Level API on Device

### Launch the Application on Device

* Duplicate the Simulation launcher
	* Go to **Run > Run Configuration...**
	* Select **mylib-test TestMyLib** launcher
	* Right-Click and select **Duplicate**
	* In **Execution** tab, select  **Execute on Device"**
* Click on **Run**

The file *microejapp.o* is generated to a well known location for the C project.

### Build the C Project

* Open the Platform C project into the C IDE 
* Compile and link the project

Please consult the documentation of the imported Platform for more details on the proceedings.
 
A similar linker error than the one below should appear in the C IDE console view:

```
Undefined symbol Java_com_mycompany_MyLib_factorial0 (referred from microejapp.o).
```

This is the normal behavior because the symbol **Java_com_mycompany_MyLib_factorial0** is currently not implemented in C code. 
The third-party linker did not find an object file implementing the native function.

### Write the C Implementation File

* In the C project, create a new File called **LLMYLIB_impl.c**
* Add the C file to the compilation objects by adding it to the C Project configuration
* Copy and paste the following code to the file:

```
#include "LLMYLIB_impl.h"
#include "sni.h"

/**
 * @file
 * @brief MicroEJ factorial low level API (the implementation does not support unsigned integer overflow)
 * @author My Company
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
uint32_t LLMYLIB_IMPL_factorial(uint32_t number)
{
	if (number == 0) {
		return 1;
	}
	uint32_t fact = 1; // this will be the result
	for (uint32_t i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
		fact *= i;
	}
	return fact;
}

```
This file defines a basic C implementation of the _factorial0_ function.

### Test the C Project

* Link the C Project. 
 
The link shall produce the executable file.

* Program the executable file on the device.
 
The following trace shall appear on the standard output:

```
VM START
(5!)=120
VM END (exit code = 0)
```

# Advanced Configuration

Configure MicroEJ SDK for using Implementation project sources before the Platform Implementation:

* Select **Window > Preferences > MicroEJ > Settings**
* Check **Resolve Foundation Library in workspace**

This avoids to rebuild the Foundation Library implementation and the Platform each time the implementation code changes.
