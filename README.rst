Overview
========

This project gathers the MicroEJâ€™s how-tos. How-tos with some code are
developed as standalone applications and as such can be run by following
the associated instructions (see **README.md** file of each example).

Note that to run them on board :

-  If you are using MicroEJ SDK

   -  You need a supported board (see
      http://developer.microej.com/index.php?resource=JPF for a list of
      supported boards using MicroEJ SDK evaluation version)
   -  And the associated platform reference implementation binary .jpf
      file (retrieve it from the previous link and import it into
      MicroEJ SDK)

-  If you are using MicroEJ Studio

   -  You need to convert them from standalone applications to sandboxed
      applications.
   -  Follow the `How-To convert a standalone app into a sandboxed
      app </StandaloneToSandboxed>`__ guide.
