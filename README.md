# Overview
This project gathers the MicroEJ's how-tos. How-tos with some code are developed as standalone applications and as such can be run by following the associated instructions (see **README.md** file of each example).

Note that to run them on board :

* If you are using MicroEJ SDK
	* You need a supported board (see http://developer.microej.com/index.php?resource=JPF for a list of supported boards using MicroEJ SDK evaluation version)
	* And the associated platform reference implementation binary .jpf file (retrieve it from the previous link and import it into MicroEJ SDK)

* If you are using MicroEJ Studio
	* You need to convert them from standalone applications to sandboxed applications.
	* Follow the [How-To convert a standalone app into a sandboxed app](/StandaloneToSandboxed) guide.

# Details
**Available Examples**:
* [Storage-Get-Started](Storage-Get-Started): Explains how to store/retrieve information in a sandboxed app.
* [StandaloneToSandboxed](StandaloneToSandboxed): Explains how to convert a standalone app into a sandboxed app.
* [MicroUI-Get-Started](MicroUI-Get-Started) contains simple examples to understand how to use the main MicroUI library APIs.
* [Widgets-Get-Started](Widgets-Get-Started) contains simple examples to understand how to use the main widget library APIs.

# Requirements
* MicroEJ Studio or SDK 4.0 or later

# Usage
Each subfolder contains a distinct how-to described in the **README.md** file of each example.
